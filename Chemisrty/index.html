    <h1>Chemisrty Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <span>periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for Iron. H for Hydrogen, and O for Oxygen. Elements are <br> classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemicals reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations.</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>)to form water(H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p>Stoichimetry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge and conserved.</p>
    <p> <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, While <sup>supercripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an iron.</p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
